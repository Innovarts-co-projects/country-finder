## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Javascript with type syntax

### What I learned

This one was my very first project using Typescript. It was definitely an amazing experience, i've been learning Typescript for almost a month and to be able to build a complete project with it is an incredible sensation. I learned a lot about this language, mainly how to use it with other React tools such as Styled Components and Axios (typing the request expected values interface).

### Useful resources

- [Theme with Styled Components and Typescript](https://medium.com/rbi-tech/theme-with-styled-components-and-typescript-209244ec15a3) - This article was very important during the development process to overcome some typing issues that i had with using styled-components on a typescript project.
